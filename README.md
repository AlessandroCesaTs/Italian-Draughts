# ITALIAN DRAUGHTS 

This repository contains the Java implementation of the classic Italian Draughts game, made by Alessandro Cesa, Federico Monti Bragadin and Simone Divo for the Software Development Methods course at Universit√† degli Studi di Trieste.

The game can be played either on a single computer, or with the two players playing against each other each one on his computer.

## How to run the software
In order to run the software and start playing, it is necessary to open the project's folder in a terminal and run the command `./gradlew run`

## Playing on one computer
If both players want to play on the same computer, they just need to click on `New Game`, insert their names, select the team (Black or White, of course the 2 players can't select the same team) and the game will start.

## Playing on two computers
